### From main page, want to select every "ul" segment where
### "class="node-readmore first last"".  Then, find the "href"
### segment within the "ul" segment, and the value of the segment
### is the link for the petition.

### Then, on every petition page, want to find the "h1" segment,
### and the text of this segment is the petition title.

### Then, find the "h4" segment where class="petition-attribution",
### and select the text in the string after the word "on."  This
### text segment includes the date on which the petition was
### published

### Then, find the "span" segment where class="signatures-number",
### and the text is the number of signatures that the petition has.

### Then, find the "div" segment where 
### "class="field field-name-field-petition-issues field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden tags""
### Within those divs, find all "h6" segments, and the text within
### each of those segments is the issue tags for the petition.
